# LifeLine
EsayAxPolygon Hakathon project

## Background 
Since 60% of the crimes goes unreported our team decided to create an application which allows victims and Bystanders to report crimes with the the ability of attaching images and video,  which police officier are then able to access. This application takes advantage of Blockchain's anonimity to encorage  people to report crimes and also Polygon's scalability, which allows to rapidly create NFTs and trasactions to be gas free.
